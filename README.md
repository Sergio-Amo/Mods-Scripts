Small collections of mods and scripts I'm using, I'll be adding more as this is just a small part of them and I'm just starting to save them here in case they're useful for someone else.

I also want to add some screenshots and better documentation so its purpose is easier to understand, at the moment there's already a readme on almost every section with instructions of how to use them.
